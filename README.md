#SpringBoot Notes
- SpringBoot makes it easy to use Spring or Spring MVC by use of auto-configurations and starter projects.
- SpringBoot looks at
    - a) Frameworks available in the classpath
    - b) Existing configurations for the application. Based on these, Spring boot provides the basic configuration needed to configure the application with these frameworks.
